### About the srsltid parameter

https://support.google.com/analytics/thread/288691031/why-google-started-to-use-srsltid-parameter-recently?hl=en

The srsltid query parameter, short for **Search Result Source Listing ID,** is added to URLs by Google Merchant Center's auto-tagging feature. It helps track the performance of specific search result links by identifying the exact click source, primarily for e-commerce businesses using Google Shopping[1][3][4]. Although intended for paid ads, it has appeared in organic search results, causing concerns about duplicate content and URL indexing[2][5]. The parameter is not indexed or crawled and is used mainly for analytics[3][6].
